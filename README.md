5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   - Answers:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python:
     - Conditional statements allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on conditions. The primary conditional statements in Python are if, elif, and else.
     - Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. The two main types of loops in Python are for and while.
   - Examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
     - if-else Statement Example
       Purpose: Execute different code blocks based on a condition.
       # Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero
       number = -10
       
       if number > 0:
           print("The number is positive.")
       elif number < 0:
           print("The number is negative.")
       else:
           print("The number is zero.")
      - for Loop Example
        Purpose: Iterate over a sequence of items and perform operations.
        # Print each item in a list
        fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
        
        for fruit in fruits:
            print(fruit)

6. Functions in Python:

       def add_numbers(a, b):
           """
           This function takes two arguments and returns their sum.
           
           Parameters:
           a (int or float): The first number.
           b (int or float): The second number.
           
           Returns:
           int or float: The sum of the two numbers.
           """
           return a + b

       # Example of how to call this function
       result = add_numbers(5, 3)
       print(result)  # Outputs: 8
       
7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   - Answers:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python:
     - Lists:
       - Structure: Ordered collection of items.
       - Syntax: Defined with square brackets [].
       - Access: Items accessed by index.
       - Mutability: Mutable; items can be added, removed, or changed.
       - Use Case: Ideal for maintaining sequences and handling ordered data.
     - Dictionaries:
       - Structure: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
       - Syntax: Defined with curly braces {} and key-value pairs separated by colons :.
       - Access: Values accessed by keys.
       - Mutability: Mutable; key-value pairs can be added, removed, or updated.
       - Use Case: Ideal for associating unique keys with values and fast lookups by key.
    - Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both:
      # Create a list of numbers
      numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
      
      # Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
      person = {
          'name': 'Alice',
          'age': 30,
          'city': 'New York'
      }
      
      # Basic operations on the list
      # 1. Access an element by index
      print("First number:", numbers[0])  # Outputs: 10
      
      # 2. Append a new element
      numbers.append(60)
      print("List after appending 60:", numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
      
      # 3. Remove an element
      numbers.remove(30)
      print("List after removing 30:", numbers)  # Outputs: [10, 20, 40, 50, 60]
      
      # 4. Iterate over the list
      print("Iterating over the list:")
      for number in numbers:
          print(number)
      
      # Basic operations on the dictionary
      # 1. Access a value by key
      print("Name:", person['name'])  # Outputs: Alice
      
      # 2. Add a new key-value pair
      person['profession'] = 'Engineer'
      print("Dictionary after adding profession:", person)
      # Outputs: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York', 'profession': 'Engineer'}
      
      # 3. Remove a key-value pair
      del person['age']
      print("Dictionary after removing age:", person)
      # Outputs: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York', 'profession': 'Engineer'}
      
      # 4. Iterate over the dictionary
      print("Iterating over the dictionary:")
      for key, value in person.items():
          print(f"{key}: {value}")

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   - Answer:
   - What is exception handling in Python: Exception handling in Python is a way to handle errors gracefully and ensure the program can recover from them or terminate cleanly. When an error occurs, an exception is raised, and if not handled, it will stop the program. Exception handling allows you to catch these exceptions and manage them appropriately.
   - Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script:
     def read_file(file_path):
         try:
             # Attempt to open and read the file
             with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                 content = file.read()
                 print("File content:")
                 print(content)
         except FileNotFoundError as e:
             # Handle the case where the file does not exist
             print(f"Error: {file_path} not found.")
         except IOError as e:
             # Handle other I/O errors
             print(f"Error: An I/O error occurred while reading {file_path}.")
         finally:
             # This block will execute no matter what, typically used for cleanup
             print("Execution completed.")

     # Example usage
     file_path = "example.txt"
     read_file(file_path)

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   - Answers:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python:
     - Definition: Single Python files (.py) containing code such as functions, classes, and variables.
     - Purpose: Organize code into logical parts.
     - Example Creation: my_module.py with functions and classes.
     - Usage: Import using import module_name
   - How can you import and use a module in your script:

     # Using math.floor to find the floor of a number
     number = 2.7
     floor_result = math.floor(number)
     print(f"The floor of {number} is {floor_result}")
     
     # Using math.radians to convert degrees to radians
     degrees = 180
     radians_result = math.radians(degrees)
     print(f"{degrees} degrees is {radians_result} radians")
     
     # Using math.degrees to convert radians to degrees
     radians = math.pi
     degrees_result = math.degrees(radians)
